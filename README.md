## Shor's Algorithm using Qiskit

Shor's algorithm is a polynomial-time quantum computer algorithm for integer factorization. Informally, it solves the following problem: Given an integer N, find its prime factors. This project shows the working of the algorithm to factor 15, implemented using Qiskit-which is an open source software development kit which can be used to create and manipulate quantum programs
